# English [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/davepagurek/English.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/davepagurek/English)

A toy English parser for Perl 6. This currently parses simple sentences (independent clauses), and will favour parsing an invalid sentence as valid over mistakenly calling a valid sentence invalid.
